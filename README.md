# iSSB-Δ Theory: A Unified Theory of Physics

This repository serves as the central hub for the development and discussion of the **iSSB-Δ Theory**, a new framework for a unified theory of physics proposed by Kosaku Tabuchi in collaboration with AI research partners.The primary purpose of this project is to refine the theory's manuscripts (Papers I-X) for journal submission by addressing peer review comments and resolving outstanding research questions.

## Project Overview

The iSSB-Δ Theory posits that the entire physical universe emerges from two fundamental axioms governing a single entity: the **Δ-field**, a quantum information-density field.All physical phenomena—spacetime, matter, and the four fundamental forces—are described as necessary consequences of the field's self-organizing process, known as **informational Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (iSSB)**.

This framework aims to provide first-principles solutions to some of the most profound challenges in modern physics, including:

  * The unification of forces and the origin of matter.
  * The nature of dark matter and dark energy.
  * The Hierarchy Problem and the Cosmological Constant Problem.
  * The origin of fundamental physical constants.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to facilitate discussion and targeted revisions of the theory's core papers.

  * **/papers**: Contains the PDF versions and source files for the iSSB-Δ Theory manuscripts (Papers I-X).
  * **/action**: Contains materials related to specific calculations and derivations, such as the action principle.
  * **/loop**: Contains notebooks and code related to loop-level calculations.
  * **/mcmc**: Contains configuration files, scripts, and data for MCMC analysis used in quantitative verification.
  * **/.github/workflows**: Contains configurations for automated tasks (CI/CD), such as compiling LaTeX documents.

## How to Contribute or Engage

This project is currently focused on addressing a series of specific research questions and revisions in preparation for academic peer review. The primary mode of collaboration is through the **Issues** tab.

1.  **Review the Issues**: Please see the [Issues tab](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/mason-tabuchi/issb-delta-revision/issues) for a complete list of current tasks, categorized by priority and topic.
2.  **Participate in Discussions**: You are welcome to contribute to the discussion within existing issues by adding comments, suggestions, or relevant references.
3.  **Propose New Issues**: If you identify a new potential problem, an area for improvement, or a question, please open a new issue.

This project represents an open inquiry into the foundations of physics, and all constructive engagement is welcome.
